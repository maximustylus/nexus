## 🧠 What is AURA?
**AURA** (Application to Understand Realtime energy and focus) is the proprietary AI Performance Coach integrated into the NEXUS platform. Designed specifically for the Sport & Exercise Medicine Centre, AURA bridges the gap between raw operational data and staff wellbeing.

It does not just read data; it interprets **cognitive load**, **scope creep**, and **burnout risk** based on clinical Job Grades (JG).

## ⚡ Core Capabilities

### 1. Deep Performance Audits
AURA ingests raw workload data (Clinical hours, Research, Education, and Management projects) and cross-references it against staff Job Grades (JG11 - JG16). 
* **Private Executive Brief:** An unfiltered, highly analytical report for Admins that calls out specific workload imbalances and burnout risks.
* **Public Team Pulse:** A morale-boosting summary designed for the wider team to celebrate wins and highlight completed projects.

### 2. Social Battery & Wellbeing 
AURA drives the intelligence behind the "Pulse" tab. By collecting simple 0-10 sliders on **Energy** and **Focus**, AURA applies Motivational Interviewing principles to recommend immediate operational adjustments (e.g., "Switch to low-cognitive tasks" or "Prime for deep work").

### 3. Contextual Dual-Identity 
AURA is fully aware of its environment. 
* **Live Mode:** It acts as the elite coach for the KKH CEP Team.
* **Demo Mode:** It seamlessly shifts its identity to analyze the simulated "Marvel Superhero CEP Team" to allow for safe demonstrations without exposing real hospital data.

## ⚠️ Interaction Guidelines for Beta Testers

When interacting with the AURA global chat widget:
1. **Focus on Operations:** Ask AURA about workload distribution, rostering conflicts, or team morale.
2. **Strictly NO PHI:** Do not type patient names, NRICs, or appointment specifics into the AURA chat. 
3. **Challenge It:** Ask it to justify its Deep Audit findings. (e.g., *"Why did you flag Peter as a high burnout risk?"*)
