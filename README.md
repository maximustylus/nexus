## 🚀 The Three Pillars of NEXUS

### Pillar A: AURA Intelligence (The Emotional Layer)
* **Objective:** Prevent burnout before it happens using real-time "Social Battery" indexing.
* **Features:** * Interactive 0-10 **Energy & Focus** sliders for staff to report daily capacity.
  * Real-time calculation of overall department operational health (Optimal vs. Critical load).
  * Dynamic status recommendations based on Motivational Interviewing techniques.

### Pillar B: Smart Workload & AI Audits (The Predictive Layer)
* **Objective:** Move away from static spreadsheets to a dynamic, real-time view of *Clinical, Research, Education, and Management* domains.
* **Features:** * **Deep AI Audits:** Powered by Gemini AI, the system generates distinct reports—a Private Executive Brief for admins (flagging specific Job Grade imbalances and scope creep) and a Public Team Pulse to celebrate wins and boost morale.
  * **Time Travel Archive:** Instantly pull historical workload data to track team progress across fiscal years.

### Pillar C: Auto Rostering (The Structural Layer)
* **Objective:** Eliminate the administrative nightmare of manual clinical scheduling.
* **Features:** Zero-conflict architecture designed to predict case volumes and automatically route the right skill-mix to the right wards.

* Features an automated guided tour of the app's core mechanics.
* Allows testers to interact with AURA, adjust sliders, and generate AI audits without writing to the live database.
* Includes a native **In-App Feedback Widget** for instant bug and idea reporting.
