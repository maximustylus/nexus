## 🚀 The Three Pillars of NEXUS

### Pillar A: AURA Intelligence (The AI Agent Layer)
AURA is an autonomous operational agent integrated into the system's core, capable of dynamic intent-routing and real-time mediation:
* **The Auto-Healer (Roster Mediation):** AURA intercepts peer-to-peer shift swap requests, automates staff notifications, and upon approval, autonomously rewrites the master calendar matrix.
* **The Wellbeing Coach:** Utilizes Motivational Interviewing (OARS) and the Mental Health Continuum to provide psychological first aid based on real-time "Social Battery" indexing.
* **The Clinical Assistant:** Instantly transitions to an analytical mode to execute secure database entries, document formatting, and enterprise-standard reports.

### Pillar B: Smart Workload & AI Audits (The Predictive Layer)
* **Deep AI Audits:** Powered by Google's Gemini models, NEXUS transforms raw data into high-level strategic insights. It generates **Private Executive Briefs** (flagging Job Grade imbalances and scope creep) and **Public Team Pulses** to align department morale.
* **Time Travel Archive:** Instantly access and analyze historical workload data to track team progression across fiscal years.

### Pillar C: Auto Rostering (The Structural Layer)
* **Zero-Conflict Architecture:** Eliminates manual scheduling friction by generating mathematically safe rosters based on predicted case volumes and specific skill-mix requirements.
* **Unified Interface:** A high-fidelity calendar view that allows staff to view coverage, sync with external calendars, and trigger integrated shift-swaps instantly.

## 🧪 Interactive Demo Mode
To facilitate safe stakeholder demonstrations and leadership training without exposing sensitive hospital data, NEXUS features a fully functional **Demo Sandbox**:
* **Simulated Environment:** Populated by a "Marvel Superhero" Healthcare Team to demonstrate complex team dynamics.
* **Risk-Free Training:** Allows future leaders to practice resolving rostering conflicts and generating AI audits without writing to the live database.
* **Feedback Loop:** Includes a native **In-App Feedback Widget** for real-time bug reporting and feature requests.
